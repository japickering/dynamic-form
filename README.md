# dynamic-form

## The User Story
This project was my solution to the 2nd part of the technical test for Shopworks to generate a dynamic form using sample JSON data they provided. This means that editing the JSON file can change the form fields and dropdowns to collect data for a range of purposes. Clicking the submit button logs the form's current state to the browser console. 

Note: On a high traffic website or enterprise level app I would have form validation in there but that's out of scope for this coding challenge.
